### Atomic

* Something that operates as an indivisible unit. That is all parts of an atomic process execute as if they were one operation. In this way they are uninterubtable or divisible by any 

### Critical Region



### Deadlock

* When one or more processes depending on another process which is depending on one of those processes to carry out a particular operation creating a unsoluble loop of dependence. This is the state of deadlock.

* A set of processes is deadlocked if each process in the set is waiting for an event that only another process in the set can cause

### External Fragmentation


### Internal Fragmentation



### Thread


### Livelock

* Livelocked processes are not blocked, change state regularly,
but never make progress

### Lock


### Mutual Exclusion (Mutex)

* Mutual exclusion is the ensurance that no two processes can simultaneously be in their critical regions


### Process



### Race Condition

* A race condition is a scenario introduced by poor concurrency managment, I.E absance or lack of synchronisation, where multiple processes/threads compete to modify a shared resource

### Spinlock

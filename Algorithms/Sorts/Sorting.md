# Sorting

## Sorting Characteristics & Properties

| Property          | Definition/Meaning                                                                             |
| ----------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stability         | A sorting algorithm is stable if it maintains the relative order of items with equal sort keys.|
| Adaptability      | Whether or not the pre-sortedness of the input affects the running time. A sorting algorithm is adaptive if it runs faster when the input is already partially sorted.                                                      |
| Comparison-based | A sorting algorithm is comparison-based if it examines the data only through comparison operators (such as < and â‰¤). Examples of where sorting algorithms are not comparison based are when an item is used with the modulo operator (as in radix sort) or as an index (as in counting sort). |
